<p>I'm a PhD student at the University of Oxford conducting research on the emerging model organism <i>Vibrio natriegens</i>. Outside my work I'm broadly interested in systems and synthetic biology, in the process and philosophy of science, and in 'deep tech' entrepreneurship. Occasionally I hope to write about these topics and post my thoughts here. You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/RezaRohani_">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reza-rohani/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
