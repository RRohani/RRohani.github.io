<h1>

<p>I am a systems and synthetic biologist passionate about combining experimental manipulation and theoretical modelling to better understand and engineer living organisms. My current PhD research is on the ultra-fast growing bacterial chassis <i>Vibrio natriegens</i>: how does its physiology give rise to its exceptional growth? and how will it affect the outcome of engineering interventions? Beyond academic curiosity I am motivated by the enormous potential of reliable 'biology by design' to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>I plan to use this site to post thoughts on systems and synthetic biology related topics.</p>
